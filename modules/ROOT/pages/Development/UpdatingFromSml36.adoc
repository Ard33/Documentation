SML3.7 brings the first round of features required for dedicated server support
and introduces a few useful utilities.

**Mods compiled for SML3.6 shouldâ„¢ still work when SML3.7 is installed**,
but **they will only work for the Windows Client target** (the game client and host-and-play multiplayer).
Mods that wish to support dedicated servers must be updated and recompiled with the new packaging settings described on this page.

First, please _read this entire page before you begin updating your mod_.
It will save you time later to have an idea going in of what to expect while updating.

After you have finished reading this page,
follow the directions on the
xref:Development/UpdatingToNewVersions.adoc[Updating your Mod]
guide to install the updated engine, starter project, and update your mod.

== Have You Updated to Update 8.1 Yet?

If you are updating your mod **directly from Update 7 (SML 3.4.x) to Update 8**,
there are more steps to follow and more changes you should be aware of.
Make sure to read the
xref:Development/UpdatingFromSml34.adoc[Updating from SML 3.4.1] guide
and xref:Development/UpdatingFromSml34.adoc[Updating from SML 3.5.1] guide
first!

[IMPORTANT]
====
Remember to not install the new engine until you have made a backup copy of the engine files, and Starter Project,
as described in the xref:Development/UpdatingToNewVersions.adoc[Updating your Mod] tutorial!
====

== Not Done Yet

The following features are not quite ready to use yet.
This section will change often, so be sure to come back here and check as you update your mods!

=== Content Registry Issue with Mod Schematics Depending on Vanilla Schematics

See https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader/issues/248[this github issue for more info].
This should not affect the vast majority of mods.

=== Decal_Normal Broken on Modded Parts using Mesh Proxies

Mesh proxies past the first instance may not render correctly.
This is a UE5 issue that Coffee Stain is working with Epic Games to resolve.
You can work around this for the time being by using a default masked material.

=== Advanced Game Settings values not saved

The xref:Development/ModLoader/SessionSettings.adoc[Session Settings] page
explains how you can create your own Advanced Game Settings.
However, their values are not currently saved with the save file.
Session Settings still function correctly - their values are saved.

== Required Changes

In addition to any specific-to-your-mod issues you may encounter,
the changes described below _must_ be made in order for your mod to be updated.

=== Understanding Alpakit Changes

Alpakit's user interface has been expanded to support the additional requirements of working with dedicated servers.
Most UI element now have detailed tooltips explaining their purpose and providing example values.

==== New Launch Game Type: Custom

The new 'Custom' Launch Type allows you to
define a system command for the Unreal Automation Tool to execute after a successful pack.
This could be used to launch the game with specific command line arguments,
load directly into a specific save file, launch additional programs,
or anything else you wish to write into a script.

Check the 'Testing' page on the modding docs for example scripts to call with this feature.
Example value: `C:\Git\SF_ModProject\RobWorkingDir\Auto_Exp_LoadLatest.bat`

==== Alpakit Dev and Alpakit Release

Alpakit now offers separate buttons for packaging for dev (your own testing) and release (for distribution)
to avoid wasting your time compiling and packaging targets that you don't plan to use in your testing.

The 'Alpakit Selected' button has been split into two:

- 'Alpakit Dev' - packages only targets you have Enabled in your Dev Packaging Settings.
- 'Alpakit Release' - packages only the targets you have checked in the Release Targets column.

The 'Alpakit!' (just this mod) button follows the same settings as the Alpakit Dev button.

==== Building Shipping For You

As of SML3.5, Alpakit is capable of building Shipping {cpp} code for you while the editor is open.
This becomes more relevant with the introduction of more targets for dedicated servers.

You show now only need to build the Development Editor Win64 target from Visual Studio,
then Alpakit will handle building Shipping targets for you as needed.

=== Dedicated Server Dependencies

You will have to install some additional tooling for dedicated server compilation to work correctly.

==== New Engine Version

Although a new engine version is something you should always be looking out for as per the
xref:Development/UpdatingToNewVersions.adoc[Updating your Mod guide],
we are drawing special attention to it here.

The latest custom engine version adjusts how {cpp} files are packaged for Linux servers.

You are probably safe to skip making a backup of your past engine version for this update
because there have been no base-game engine changes since SML 3.6.1.

==== New Wwise Deployment Platform

You must modify your Wwise install to include the `Linux` deployment platform
and re-integrate Wwise into the project.

The steps for modifying your Wwise install can be found
link:https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/library/wwise_launcher/?source=InstallGuide&id=unity_unreal_integrations_plugins[in the Wwise documentation].
You only need to **add the `Linux` platform** -
note that the Wwise documentation is generalized and does not have it checked in their screenshots.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to not accidentally update your Wwise version
or install any additional Wwise plugins
in the process of adding the deployment platform!
You don't need them and it'll waste disk space.
====

You will defintely need to re-integrate Wwise into the project after making this modification
as covered on the xref:Development/UpdatingToNewVersions.adoc[Updating your Mod guide].

==== Clang Toolchain

Cross-compiling from Windows to Linux requires
the compatible version of Unreal Engine specific Clang Toolchain to be installed.

Installing the Clang toolchain is covered in the
xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/dependencies.adoc#ClangToolchain[Dependencies] guide.

==== Configuring Release Targets

You must tell Alpakit which release targets you wish to compile your mod for.

Configuring these settings is covered in more detail on the
xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/ReleaseMod.adoc#PackageForUpload[Releasing Your Mod] page.

In most cases, you probably want to check every release target (Windows, Windows Server, Linux Server).

==== Testing your Mod on a Dedicated Server

The xref:Development/TestingResources.adoc#TestingDedicatedServers[Testing/Multiplayer Testing]
covers how to set up and connect to a dedicated server to test your mods on.

Remember that dedicated servers have no host player.
Any issues your mod already has with host-and-play multiplayer are probably still present on dedicated servers,
potentially exacerbated due to the lack of a host player.

==== New Multi-Target Zip

A new multi-target zip file is used to hold uploads to SMR which contains all files for each supported target platform.

Before uploading your mod to SMR you must now use 'Alpakit Release' and upload the multi-target zip file.

This procedure is covered on the xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/ReleaseMod.adoc#PackageForUpload[Releasing Your Mod] page.

== Additional Changes

You might not be affected by these changes,
but we'd like to draw extra attention to them.

=== Content Registry Functionality Changes

==== Include Non Solids flag

The Include Non Solids flag should now be functioning as described in its doc comment - it previously did nothing.
