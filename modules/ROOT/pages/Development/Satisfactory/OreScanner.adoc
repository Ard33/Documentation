= Ore Scanner

[NOTE]
====
This page is a work in progress.
====

In order to add a custom ore node type to the ore scanner,
you should grant the player a schematic with an 
xref:Development/Satisfactory/Schematic.adoc#_fgunlock_ufgunlock[FGUnlock]
of type UnlockScannableResource.

If you dynamically spawn ore nodes that are not part of the game level,
they will not appear on the scanner unless you call the AFGResourceScanner GenerateNodeClustersAccessor function
to rebuild the scanner's internal data.
