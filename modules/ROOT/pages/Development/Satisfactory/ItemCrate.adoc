= Item Crates

If you dismantle a building and you don't have enough space in your inventory to hold its ingredients and contents,
Satisfactory will spawn a temporary crate containing those items instead.

You may wish to reuse this functionality for your own purposes in mods.

== Spawning Item Crates

Remember that spawning actors and performing inventory operations
should be done with authority (server side) in multiplayer.

To spawn an item crate with items from an MInventoryStack array:

1. Spawn actor BP_Crate
** Make sure to use an "Always Spawns" collision handling option to ensure the crate is always spawned
2. Call "Set Allow Adding Items" with `true` on the crate actor
3. Call the FGInventoryLibrary utility function "Get Min Num Slots for Items" with the crate actor and array of items
4. Get the crate's inventory component and call Resize with the num slots, then call Add Stacks
5. (Optional) Clear the array of MInventoryStack entries to ensure you don't duplicate them later on accident
