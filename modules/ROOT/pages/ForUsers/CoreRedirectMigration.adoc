= Migrating Modded Content with Core Redirects

Unreal Engine's **Core Redirects** feature can be used to force
the game to replace modded content with alternative content, under certain conditions.

The following use cases are particularly relevant for users of mods:

* Uninstalling a mod, but replacing its buildings with the closest base-game equivalent
* Migrating from one mod to another mod that offers similar buildings

Core Redirects are the system that modders can use to ensure saved content is not lost when they move it internally inside their mods.
Mod developers can read more about this on the xref:Development/UnrealEngine/CoreRedirect.adoc[mod-developer-focused page about Core Redirects].

== Restrictions

Using core redirects may not work for your use case. Carefully consider the following:

* Core Redirects can only be used to replace _every_ instance of content with another. You can't replace just the constructors in one building, the operation applies to your entire save file
* For the redirect to take effect, the old content must become undefined or unloaded
** You can cause this manually by uninstalling the mod that contains the old content
** It's not possible to replace _part_ of a mod's buildings, you must replace everything from that mod, or accept that you will lose the content that was not migrated
* You must find out the Asset Path of the new and old content
** This requires some non-trivial work on your end
** Finding asset paths will be covered in another section
* The new content must be similar enough in internal structure to the old content
** As a user, it's not always clear if this is possible, even if it seems like it "should" be. You will have to try it and see.
** Keep in mind that **if this process doesn't work, there is not really anything you can change to make it work**. The restrictions on what can be replaced with what stem from what the content is and how it was implemented in the mod.
** For example, you can sometimes replace a modded belt with another modded belt, or a modded power pole with a vanilla power pole, but replacing a constructor with a foundation won't work

[id="BackUpSaves"]
== Step 1: Back Up Your Saves!

Before you start messing with core redirects, back up your saves.
If you make a mistake, you could lose content or even corrupt your save file.
Both of these risks are entirely avoided by simply making a backup of your save files first.

[id="FindAssetPathOld"]
== Step 2: Find the Asset Path of the Content to Replace

In order to write a core redirect,
you must obtain the Unreal Asset Paths for the content you want to replace
and what you want to replace it with.

An asset path is a string that represents where the content is stored in the mod's packaged files.
Although it may look similar to a traditional file path, you can't simply browse to it in your file explorer.
Read the sections below to learn how to find asset paths.

They generally look like this:
`/Game/FactoryGame/Buildable/Building/Foundation/Build_Foundation_8x1_01.Build_Foundation_8x1_01_C`

Finding the asset paths is the most difficult part of the process, so don't be discouraged if it takes a while to figure out.

=== You Can Load Into the Save File

If you can still load into a save that contains the old content,
finding the asset path is relatively straightforward.
Two different approaches are described below.

[id="ContentInspectorMethod_InSaveFile"]
==== Content Inspector Method

The https://ficsit.app/mod/ContentInspector[Content Inspector] mod
allows you to browse a mod's content in-game in a file-explorer-like interface.
Read its mod page for examples and usage instructions.

Look at a building and use the the `/inspect this` chat command to attempt to open Content Inspector on what your character is looking at.

Content Inspector displays the path to the class default object (not quite what we want, but close) in the `JS_LibOuter` field near the top of the text box.

image:ForUsers/CoreRedirectMigration/ContentInspector.png[Content Inspector showing the asset path of a building]

For example, the 8m x 1m Foundation displays this in ContentInspector:

`/Game/FactoryGame/Buildable/Building/Foundation/Build_Foundation_8x1_01.Default__Build_Foundation_8x1_01_C`

...which you can edit to get the asset path of:

`/Game/FactoryGame/Buildable/Building/Foundation/Build_Foundation_8x1_01.Build_Foundation_8x1_01_C`

[id="TFITMethod_InSaveFile"]
==== TFIT Method

Debugging features in the https://ficsit.app/mod/TFIT[TFIT] mod can display asset paths for you.

For buildings, enable the "Overlay: Debug Mode" and "Overlay: Logging" mod config options
and the asset path will be printed in your xref:faq.adoc#Files_Logs[log files].

image:ForUsers/CoreRedirectMigration/TFIT.png[TFIT showing the asset path of a building in the log files]

Remember to turn these options off after you're done because they produce a lot of log spam.

Other debugging features in the mod can reveal item and recipe paths.
See the bottom of the mod page for more details.

=== You Can't Load Into the Save File

If you can't load into the save file, finding the asset path is more difficult, and your options are limited.

[id="ContentInspectorMethod_FromMenu"]
==== Content Inspector Method (from the main menu)

If you still have the mod offering the content installed, Content Inspector can also be used to browse mod assets from the main menu.
See the link:#ContentInspectorMethod_InSaveFile[directions above] for more information about this tool.

==== Use External Software

If you have a copy of the mod, but the game can't launch, you can use the external software xref:Development/ExtractGameFiles.adoc#FModel[FModel]
to browse the mod's package files with the game closed and find the asset path that way.

You may also be able to use save editors that display class information about your save file.

[id="FindAssetPathNew"]
== Step 3: Find the Asset Path of the New Content to Replace With

Do Step 2 again, but this time you're looking for the asset path of the 'new' content.

[id="CreateCoreRedirectIni"]
== Step 4: Create the Core Redirect File

. Close the game, if you currently have it open
. Create a new text file `Engine.ini` in the following location: `[GameInstallFolder]\FactoryGame\Mods\SML\Config`
* Note that any mod's config folder will work, SML's is just a convenient place to put it
. Ensure that the file extension is `.ini` and not `.ini.txt`
. Edit the file to add the following content as a template:

```ini
[CoreRedirects]
+ClassRedirects=(OldName="YOUR_OLD_PATH_HERE",NewName="YOUR_NEW_PATH_HERE")
```

Now, put the asset path for the content you want to replace in place of `YOUR_OLD_PATH_HERE`
and the new content's asset path in place of `YOUR_NEW_PATH_HERE`.

Compare against the link:#Examples[examples below] to ensure you've formatted it correctly.

If you want to replace more than one type of content at once,
you can add more `+ClassRedirects` lines and repeat steps 2 and 3 to find paths to use.

[id="VerifySuccess"]
== Step 5: Making Sure it Worked

Once your `Engine.ini` file is set up and saved, launch the game and load your save file.

Go around your save and look around to see if the core redirect succeeded.
Core redirects are all-or-nothing, so if you see one place where it didn't work,
you don't need to check anywhere else in the save, just quit out and check your core redirect file syntax.

If it didn't work,
make sure your class paths end in `_C`, don't contain `Default__`,
and are correctly encased in quotes and parentheses like in the examples below.

[id="CleanUp"]
== Step 6: Clean Up

Hooray! You've successfully migrated your content.

Once you save your game and exit, the redirect will have permanently replaced the old content with the new content in that save file.

As such, you don't need the redirectors any more, so go back to `[GameInstallFolder]\FactoryGame\Mods\SML\Config` and remove the `Engine.ini` file you created.

[id="Examples"]
== Examples

Here are some examples of known-to-work core redirects.

[id="Example_BeltReplace"]
=== Replacing Modded Belt with Vanilla Belt

Replaces all Conveyor Belts and Lifts from the https://ficsit.app/mod/BeltMk6[Conveyor Belt Mk6*] mod with Mk5 versions from the base game.

```ini
[CoreRedirects]
+ClassRedirects=(OldName="/BeltMk6/Buildable/ConveyorLiftMk6/Build_ConveyorLiftMk6.Build_ConveyorLiftMk6_C",NewName="/Game/FactoryGame/Buildable/Factory/ConveyorLiftMk5/Build_ConveyorLiftMk5.Build_ConveyorLiftMk5_C")
+ClassRedirects=(OldName="/BeltMk6/Buildable/ConveyorBeltMk6/Build_ConveyorBeltMk6.Build_ConveyorBeltMk6_C",NewName="/Game/FactoryGame/Buildable/Factory/ConveyorBeltMk5/Build_ConveyorBeltMk5.Build_ConveyorBeltMk5_C")
```

=== Replacing Flex Power Lines with Vanilla Power Lines

Replace all Flex Power Lines from the https://ficsit.app/mod/FlexSplines[Flex Splines] mod with the base game's Power Lines.
Note that they may render incorrectly due to the different placement restrictions.

```ini
[CoreRedirects]
+ClassRedirects=(OldName="/FlexSplines/PowerLine/Build_FlexPowerline.Build_FlexPowerline_C",NewName="/Game/FactoryGame/Buildable/Factory/PowerLine/Build_PowerLine.Build_PowerLine_C")
```
