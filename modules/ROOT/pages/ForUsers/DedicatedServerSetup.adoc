= Installing Mods on Dedicated Servers

[IMPORTANT]
====
Dedicated Server support is still a work in progress,
which is why we haven't publicly announced it yet!

Expect changes to the setup process as functionality is finalized
and be patient as mods are updated 
====

SML3.7.0 enables the compilation of mods for Dedicated Servers.
Keep in mind that Coffee Stain considers the base game's dedicated servers to be
an experimental, incomplete feature, so modded dedicated servers are experimental squared!
Expect bugs and test carefully to determine if bugs are caused by the base game or by mods
before reporting them on the https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/[QA site] (base-game)
or the Discord (modded) respectively.

== Obtain a Server

You need access to a dedicated server before you can start installing mods on it.
Pick one of the options below to set one up.

[id="SelfHostedServer"]
=== Option 1: Self Hosted Server

Hosting a server yourself is the best way to
ensure you can work with the files required to get modded a server working.
First, set up a copy of the vanilla dedicated server if you haven't done so yet.
The Satisfactory Official Wiki already has a
https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Dedicated_servers[detailed guide covering how to do this].
Follow that guide, then continue to the link:#GetModManager[next section].

[id="ThirdPartyServer"]
=== Option 2: Third Party Hosted Server

[WARNING]
====
We can only provided limited support for third-party hosted servers
as we do not know or control their systems.
Contact your server host's support lines if you encounter problems.
====

Third-party server hosts often restrict how you can access and modify files on the system,
complicating the mod setup process.

You will have to follow your server host's own documentation about mod setup.
If your server host provides (s)ftp access to server files
the Mod Manager and ficsit-cli _should_ be able to interact with them normally.

With this in mind, continue to the link:#GetModManager[next section].

[id="GetModManager"]
== Install a Mod Manager

Both Satisfactory Mod Manager (version 3.0.0 and up) and ficsit-cli
can be used to manage mods on a remote server installation
as long as you have network filesystem or (s)ftp access to the server.
You could also install ficsit-cli on the server and interact with its file system directly via its terminal user interface.

[id="GetModManager_SMM"]
=== Satisfactory Mod Manager

// cspell:ignore CIFS
[NOTE]
====
SMM cannot currently connect to servers by filesystem path, including SMB/CIFS or network mounts.
Use ficsit-cli for this in the mean time.
====

If using the Mod Manager to manage your server:

. xref:ForUsers/SatisfactoryModManager.adoc[Download and install the Satisfactory Mod Manager].
. Open the Mod Manager.
. In the left panel, under Other, select "Manage Servers".
   * If you don't see this option, ensure that you have installed the latest version of the Mod Manager,
     as only versions 3.0.0 and up support this feature.
. Enter server connection details in the popup window.
   * Decide what method to select and what to enter by reading the link:#FileTransferMethods[File Transfer Methods] section,
     then return here.
. The server will now appear in your Game Version dropdown and can be managed like a local install.
. Skim the below ficsit-cli section to stay informed, then continue reading the link:#ServerClientConsistency[next setup step].

[id="GetModManager_CLI"]
=== ficsit-cli

If using ficsit-cli to manage your server:

. Download https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/ficsit-cli[ficsit-cli]
   either to your computer or to the server itself
   depending on which environment you are more comfortable working with.
. Run the application in a terminal window.
. Navigate to the "Installations" > "New Installation" screen.
. Enter server connection details in the popup window.
  a. If you are running ficsit-cli from your computer (not the server),
     enter the server connection details. 
   * Decide what to enter here by reading the link:#FileTransferMethods[File Transfer Methods] section,
     then return here.
  b. If ficsit-cli is installed on the server,
     enter the file system path, for example `D:\SatisfactoryDS` or `/opt/SatisfactoryDedicatedServer`.
. The server will now appear as an install you can select and manage as usual.
. Read the below, then continue reading the link:#ServerClientConsistency[next setup step].

Make sure to apply changes after installing mods or loading a profile,
otherwise all changes will be discarded on exit.

Note that applying changes in ficsit-cli is a global action -
all installations the program is aware of will have any staged changes they may have applied in parallel.
This does _not_ mean that all installs must be on the same profile.

[id="FileTransferMethods"]
== File Transfer Methods

The Mod Manager and ficsit-cli support multiple methods of connecting to servers remotely to manage mod files.
Select a method below based on what your server (or 3rd party server host) provides.

[id="FileTransferMethods_SFTP"]
=== SFTP

Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a common method to transfer files over the Internet/Network.
It's more modern and secure than FTP as you may have guessed from its name.
SFTP typically uses TCP port 22, but your server may differ.
The examples below are for a self-hosted dedicated server.

* The authenticating user requires Read/Write/Delete or Read/Modify permissions.
* The path should follow this format:
+
`sftp://username:password@ServerNameOrIP:Port/path/`

[id="FileTransferMethods_FTP"]
=== FTP

[WARNING]
====
You should use link:#FileTransferMethods_SFTP[SFTP] instead if it is available.
====

File transfer protocol (FTP) is a common but outdated method to transfer files over the Internet/Network.
FTP typically uses TCP port 21, but your server may differ.
The examples below are for a self-hosted dedicated server.

* The authenticating user requires Read/Write/Delete or Read/Modify permissions.
* The path should follow this format:
+
`ftp://username:password@ServerNameOrIP:Port/path/`

[id="FileTransferMethods_SMB"]
=== SMB/CIFS

Server Message Block (SMB), also known as CIFS (Common Internet File System) or Windows File Shares,
is a network file transfer method commonly used on Windows Systems and occasionally Linux/Unix systems.
SMB typically uses TCP port 445, but your server may differ.
The examples below are for a self-hosted dedicated server.

* The authenticating user requires Read/Write/Delete or Read/Modify permissions.
* The path should follow this format:
** If using a Windows ficsit-cli install:
+
`\\ServerNameOrIP\ShareName\Path` or `//ServerNameOrIP/ShareName/Path`
** If using a Linux ficsit-cli install:
+
link:https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/ficsit-cli/issues/57[(A bug is currently preventing this from working)]

** Satisfactory Mod Manager does not currently support SMB connections.
   A future release (soon(TM)) will add support for this.

[id="ServerClientConsistency"]
== Server-Client Consistency

Although it is possible to use ficsit-cli or the Mod Manager to install mods one-by-one on the server,
this is not recommended as you could easily end up with a mismatch between client and server mod versions,
preventing you from connecting.

It is not feasible to export a profile created in SMM for a client to be used on a server
because there are some mods that only exist client or server side.
In the future, the ability to create and share "modpacks" will resolve this problem,
as modpacks will be able to keep track of mods that may not apply for a game target.

In the mean time, we suggest using an installation of SMM or ficsit-cli on your client computer
so that you can use the same profile to manage both your client and remote server install.
You can then export the SMM or ficsit-cli profile
and send file to your server members so they can configure their own installs accordingly.

If you encounter any one-side-only mods
you will have to switch to using separate profiles for the server and client until the Modpacks feature is released.

== Configuring Mods on Servers

Although xref:ForUsers/ConfiguringMods.adoc#_mod_savegame_settings[Mod Savegame Settings]
can be configured using their usual interface,
there is not currently an interface for adjusting
xref:ForUsers/ConfiguringMods.adoc#_mod_configuration_options[Mod Configurations]
remotely on dedicated servers.
As a result, you should configure mods client side and copy the config files over to the server.

Note that some mods could stop working correctly or behave unexpectedly if client and server configs don't match.

Check the xref:faq.adoc#Files_ModConfig[FAQ on where game files are located] to see where config files are stored.

== (Not supported) Manual Mod Installation

[WARNING]
====
We do not provide support on the Discord for dedicated servers that have had mods manually installed.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do NOT naively copy-paste your client's mods folder to a server - this will not work!
The compiled files used by the game client will not work on dedicated servers,
so trying to give them client files will result in vague error messages.
====

It is possible to manually install mods on dedicated server installs
without the help of the Mod Manager of ficsit-cli,
however the process of doing so will vary based on your server
and you will have to manually ensure you have downloaded compatible versions and all of their dependencies.

The steps described in the xref:ManualInstallDirections.adoc[Manual Installation]
directions for clients still generally apply,
but be sure to download the correct target platform version of the mod for your server.
